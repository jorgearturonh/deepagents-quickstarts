# 🚀 Deep Research

## 🚀 Quickstart

**Prerequisites**: Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Ensure you are in the `deep_research` directory:
```bash
cd deep_research
```

Install packages:
```bash
uv sync
```

Set your API keys in your environment:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here  # Required for default Claude model
export TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here        # Optional, for web search ([get one here](https://www.tavily.com/)) with a generous free tier]
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_langsmith_api_key_here    # [LangSmith API key](https://smith.langchain.com/settings) (free to sign up)
```

Run Jupyter notebook:

```bash
uv run jupyter notebook research_agent.ipynb
```

Run local [LangGraph server](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/langgraph-platform/local-server/):

```bash
uv run --extra langgraph langgraph dev
```

### Custom Model

By default, `deepagents` uses `"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"`. You can customize this by passing any [LangChain model object](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/). See the Deepagents package [README](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents?tab=readme-ov-file#model) for more details.

```python
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model
from deepagents import create_deep_agent

model = init_chat_model("openai:gpt-5.1")
agent = create_deep_agent(
    model=model,
)
```

### Custom Instructions

The deep research agent uses custom instructions defined in `deep_research/research_agent/prompts.py` that complement (rather than duplicate) the default middleware instructions. You can modify these in any way you want. 

| Instruction Set | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `RESEARCH_WORKFLOW_INSTRUCTIONS` | Defines the 5-step research workflow: save request → plan with TODOs → delegate to sub-agents → synthesize → respond. Includes research-specific planning guidelines like batching similar tasks and scaling rules for different query types. |
| `SUBAGENT_DELEGATION_INSTRUCTIONS` | Provides concrete delegation strategies with examples: simple queries use 1 sub-agent, comparisons use 1 per element, multi-faceted research uses 1 per aspect. Sets limits on parallel execution (max 3 concurrent) and iteration rounds (max 3). |
| `RESEARCHER_INSTRUCTIONS` | Guides individual research sub-agents to conduct focused web searches. Includes hard limits (2-3 searches for simple queries, max 5 for complex), emphasizes using `think_tool` after each search for strategic reflection, and defines stopping criteria. |

### Custom Tools

The deep research agent adds the following custom tools beyond the built-in deepagent tools. You can also use your own tools, including via MCP servers. See the Deepagents package [README](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents?tab=readme-ov-file#mcp) for more details.

| Tool Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `tavily_search` | Web search tool that uses Tavily purely as a URL discovery engine. Performs searches using Tavily API to find relevant URLs, fetches full webpage content via HTTP with proper User-Agent headers (avoiding 403 errors), converts HTML to markdown, and returns the complete content without summarization to preserve all information for the agent's analysis. |
| `think_tool` | Strategic reflection mechanism that helps the agent pause and assess progress between searches, analyze findings, identify gaps, and plan next steps. |
